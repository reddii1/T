Test cases interactions prompts are stored in .csv files under F:\Nectar\CXA\liferay-ce-portal-7.4.3.78-ga78\test-case-data
As these files are often updated they should be versioned controlled to keep track of changes
Possibly, they can be pushed to a branch of ta-nectar-backup project on Gitlab using its REST API from the running instance of Nectar, before a new version is deployed, as part of the pipeline
There could be 2 project branches, test-case-data-dev and test-case-data-live.
The commit message could include the Nectar version the backup is sent from
The .csv can then be pulled via API to restore them in newly deployed Nectar CX instances

Currently .csv files are zipped and manually uploaded via curl command to the Package Registry, before running the deployment pipeline,and then downloaded onto the new instance
